  description: 'Control lights with a Moes Smart Knob.
    You can set functions for a single press. This allows you to assign, e.g., a scene
    or anything else.
    Rotating left/right will change the brightness smoothly of the selected light.
    Not all functionality of the device is available at time of writing, e.g. double
    press, long press and press and rotate.
